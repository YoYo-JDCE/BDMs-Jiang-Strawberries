# BDMs-Jiang-Strawberries: Supplemental Strawberry Results

This GitHub repository provides supplementary results for strawberries, building upon the research paper:

Jiang, J., T. L. Marsh, and E. Belasco. 2025. “Optimizing microplastic pollution in a terrestrial environment: a case for soil-biodegradable mulches.” *Agricultural and Resource Economics Review*. [https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2025.20](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2025.20)

For the original analysis based on tomatoes, please refer to the primary GitHub repository: [https://github.com/YoYo-JDCE/BDMs-Jiang-Marsh-Belasco](https://github.com/YoYo-JDCE/BDMs-Jiang-Marsh-Belasco). It is recommended to review the tomato-based research before exploring the preliminary strawberry results in this repository.
